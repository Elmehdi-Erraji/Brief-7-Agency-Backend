# Project Documentation: Your Interface Startup Platform Enhancement

## Overview
As a dedicated full-stack developer at YourInterface Technologies, the project aimed to bridge the gap between frontend and backend development. 
The initial phase involved proposing a complete website concept with essential features. After successfully validating the frontend part with the client, the focus shifted to building a robust backend for efficient content management.

## Objectives
- **Database Design**: Formulate a suitable database schema precisely meeting the site's requirements.
- **UML Modeling**: Develop comprehensive UML diagrams describing entities, relationships, and constraints within the database.
- **Front end**: Develop a web interfaces using HTML, CSS, JS and Boostrap.
- **PHP and SQL Scripts**: Develop functional PHP and SQL scripts to construct a user-friendly dashboard capable of performing CRUD operations for at least three entities while documenting the code clearly and concisely.
- **Performance Optimization**: Perform load tests to evaluate system robustness and optimize SQL queries for enhanced performance.

## User Stories for Content Manager
The aim was to provide the platform administrator with the ability to:
- **Data Management**: Add, modify, and delete all entities as indicated in the UML diagram.
- **Information Visualization**: Display data in a clear and intuitive manner.
- **Access to Statistics**: Retrieve key statistics to assess the platform's effectiveness.
- **Content Management Facilitation**: Offer an intuitive interface with forms for easy content management.

## Repository Contents
- **README**: This document.
- **Functional PHP Scripts**: Backend functionalities.
- **SQL Script**: Database configuration.
- **ERD and UML Diagrams**: Use case, class diagrams and ERD diagrams.

## Authentication System, Role Management, Security, and Project Status
### Authentication System and Role Management
The project involves implementing a robust authentication system and role management to ensure secure access to various sections based on user roles. It includes:
- **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality to authenticate users.
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Managing user roles (e.g., admin, developer, client) and granting appropriate access privileges.
- **Session Management**: Handling user sessions securely to maintain authenticated access.

### Implemented Security Measures
#### Prevention of Injection Attacks
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Utilization of prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Data Sanitization**: Validating and sanitizing user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.

#### Secure Password Handling
- **Password Hashing**: Storing passwords securely using cryptographic hashing algorithms.
- **Salted Hashes**: Implementing salted hashes for additional security of stored passwords.

### Ongoing Development
The project is currently ongoing and is in the development phase. While significant progress has been made in implementing various features, including the backend functionalities, authentication, and security measures mentioned above, the project is not yet completed. Continuous development, testing, and refinement are being carried out to enhance performance, optimize functionalities, and ensure robust security.
